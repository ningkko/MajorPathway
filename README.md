# MajorPathway
Educational game; \
CSC 220 Final Project - Spring 2018 @Smith

## Introduction
We want to build an RPG game to help students at Smith better understand the paths towards CS major and minor. \
The game scenes mimic environments of the CS building Ford. The player has to walk around the bulding, take courses, communicate with professor, attend special events, declare major/minor and manage to graduate. 

## How to run:
#### Notice: Python 3.6.5 required.
Download the zip file and unzip it to a directory.\
Run MajorPathway.py under the MajorPathyway file.
#### Note: 
We have a Question.text where questions of different courses are assigned, and its example question reference text Q1.text. \
To add more questions, add question texts in the same format as Q1.text. \
Then return to Question.txt and add the name of the question text (e.g."Q1.txt") in the same format as Q1.txt is added.
