# MajorPathway
Educational game; \
CSC 220 Final Project - Spring 2018 @Smith

## Introduction
Students, especially first years, often feel overwhelmed by the rich and rigorous course offerings and major requirements when they transition to college - They are expected to find all related information at the department website on their own.\
Although the website is a good resource, some further explanations are necessary to provide students with a big picture of their education. \
With the goal of informing students in an interactive way, we want to build a browser “role playing game” to help students better understand the paths towards Computer Science majors and minors at Smith. \
Ideally, it informs the players about the course offerings of CS department and the tracks they may go through. After playing this game, students would have a basic idea about what a CS major student’s education looks like.

## How to run:
#### Notice: Python 3.6.5 required.
Download the zip file and unzip it to a directory.\
Run MajorPathway.py
#### Note: 
We have a Question.text where questions of different courses are assigned, and its example question reference text Q1.text. \
To add more questions, add question texts in the same format as Q1.text. \
Then return to Question.txt and add the name of the question text (e.g."Q1.txt") in the same format as Q1.txt is added.
